Now tracked by the `wayland` branch of my dotfiles repository ([here](https://github.com/itsdrike/dotfiles/tree/wayland)),
which should eventually make it's way to the primary branch (see [this PR](https://github.com/ItsDrike/dotfiles/pull/4)).

Since this is now tracked in the regular dotfiles repository, I'm archiving this repository, and it's scheduled for removal within a few weeks/days.
